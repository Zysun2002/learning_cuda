Here is a record of  my first CUDA Codes learned from @kwea123 on Youtube.

Following his tutorial, I created my first CUDA codes which is an implementation of trilinear interpolatio, involving a forward funciton and a backward function.

The next step is to dive into the cuda implementation of 3G Gaussian Splatting.
